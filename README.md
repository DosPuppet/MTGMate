# Planecircle

A platform for playing Magic: The Gathering against one or more AIs (head-to-head or multiplayer) and online against other players (2 to 4, best-of-three in duels; Standard, Unlimited or Commander). It is built on a **home-grown rules engine in TypeScript** and a 2D interface designed to be a fast way to play and test decks:

- automatic priority passing, with a stop on "End turn" at the end of each of your turns (even with nothing to play);
- automatic mana payment;
- configurable stops;
- target chosen automatically when there is only one;
- drag and drop;
- cards playable from outside the hand (flashback, land from the graveyard, exile, top of the library) shown at the end of the hand, with a label giving their zone;
- modified mana cost (reduction, tax, flashback) shown on the card in hand;
- AI at three selectable levels (beginner, medium, high), from heuristic play to ISMCTS search in duels (see docs/ai.md);
- browsable exile: a button next to the graveyard, and cards exiled by a permanent shown under it (hover to see them);
- playable on tablets and on phones in landscape (see "Tablet and phone");
- card images relayed by the server when the player's network blocks Scryfall (see "Images blocked by the network");
- cards in French or English: name, text and illustration of the matching printing (the French printing of another set when the original does not exist in French; text completed by hand when Scryfall does not have it).

**Every card legal in Standard is playable** (last set added: The Hobbit, 188 / 188). Latest addition: **Commander**, for 2 to 4 players, against the AI and online, with sixteen preconstructed decks (Edgar Markov, Y'shtola, The Ur-Dragon, Rakdos, Lord of Riots, The Vision, Dark Leo & Shredder, The Ur-Sphinx, Vivi Ornitier, Sephiroth, Mario & Luigi, Tevesh Szat & Jeska, and the official precons of Reality Fracture, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Final Fantasy X, The Fantastic Four and Fallout); further decks arrive one at a time, each with its cards.

## Scope: Standard

The target scope before any set is the **Standard format**: constructed, 60 cards minimum, 4 copies maximum (except basic lands and "any number" cards), 15-card sideboard.

Cards were covered **set by set, at 100% before moving on to the next** (except during the "meta" phase of plan P4, see below): every card legal in Standard is playable. All Standard sets are imported (texts, legalities, faces); a card the engine does not handle would appear greyed out in the deckbuilder, marked "coming soon".

**Sets legal in Standard as of 2026-09-25** (source: Scryfall, to be rechecked at each rotation):

| Set | Cards handled |
|---|---|
| **Foundations (FDN)** | ✅ 517 / 517 |
| **Reality Fracture (FRA)** | ✅ 279 / 279 |
| **Edge of Eternities (EOE)** | ✅ 260 / 260 |
| **Aetherdrift (DFT)** | ✅ 260 / 260 |
| **Outlaws of Thunder Junction (OTJ) and The Big Score (BIG)** | ✅ 269 / 269 and 30 / 30 |
| **Final Fantasy (FIN)** | ✅ 307 / 307 |
| **Duskmourn: House of Horror (DSK)** | ✅ 268 / 268 |
| **Bloomburrow (BLB)** | ✅ 266 / 266 |
| **The Lost Caverns of Ixalan (LCI)** | ✅ 279 / 279 |
| **Tarkir: Dragonstorm (TDM)** | ✅ 259 / 259 |
| **Lorwyn Eclipsed (ECL)** | ✅ 266 / 266 |
| **Wilds of Eldraine (WOE)** | ✅ 269 / 269 |
| **Secrets of Strixhaven (SOS)** | ✅ 262 / 262 |
| **Murders at Karlov Manor (MKM)** | ✅ 271 / 271 |
| **Avatar: The Last Airbender (TLA)** | ✅ 280 / 280 |
| **Marvel Super Heroes (MSH)** | ✅ 271 / 271 |
| **Marvel's Spider-Man (SPM)** | ✅ 188 / 188 |
| **Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMT)** | ✅ 188 / 188 |
| **The Hobbit (HOB)** | ✅ 188 / 188 |

In total, **5,164 playable cards** out of 5,164 cards legal in Standard (100%, checked every week against Scryfall: `tools/check-legality.ts`). The lines above add up to 5,177 cards: they also count the 13 banned cards, which are handled but refused by deck validation, except in the "Unlimited" format (chosen on the home screen, against the AI, and when creating an online game), which accepts any card in the catalog regardless of its legality.

**Reprints, for the Unlimited format** (plan G, history in `docs/history.md`): the Special Guests and the bonus sheets released with the sets above, outside Standard, with the illustration of the reprint. Cards with Commander-only mechanics (partner, eminence…) wait for a Commander deck that asks for them (plan E).

| Set | Cards handled |
|---|---|
| Special Guests (SPG) | 132 / 132 |
| Stellar Sights (EOS) | 43 / 43 |
| Enchanting Tales (WOT) | 55 / 55 |
| Breaking News (OTP) | 61 / 61 |
| Through the Ages (FCA) | 50 / 50 |
| Mystical Archive (SOA) | 37 / 37 |
| Source Material (PZA) | 15 / 15 |
| Jurassic World Collection (REX) | 20 / 20 |

**Meta decks (plan P4, phase 1 finished):** before finishing the last sets one by one, the cards of the most played Standard decks were written (MTGGoldfish survey of 2026-09-29, `docs/meta/`). The **twenty archetypes surveyed** (88.1% of the meta) are playable, sideboard included; the top five are offered as preconstructed decks (Izzet Spellementals, Mono-Green Landfall, Dimir Midrange, Jund Sacrifice, 4c Control). A few reprints from older sets are also legal because they appear in those sets.

**Banned in Standard** (13):

- Abuelo's Awakening
- Badgermole Cub
- Cori-Steel Cutter
- Gran-Gran
- Heartfire Hero
- Hopeless Nightmare
- Monstrous Rage
- Proft's Eidetic Memory
- Screaming Nemesis
- Stormchaser's Talent
- This Town Ain't Big Enough
- Up the Beanstalk
- Vivi Ornitier

**Commander (plan E, history in `docs/history.md`):** format rules (command zone, tax, return to the command zone offered to the owner, commander damage, 40 life, color identity, partner pairs, singleton, Scryfall's ban list and Game Changers, free first mulligan), for 2 to 4 players, against the AI and online (with AI seats run by the server), Commander deck editor (100 cards, identity, bracket estimated from the Game Changers). Sixteen playable precons: Edgar Markov (vampires, Mardu) and Y'shtola, Night's Blessed (drain and control, Esper), from the EDHREC average lists at bracket 4 (2026-10-06), The Ur-Dragon (Dragons, five colors, Moxfield list "How to Train Ur-Dragon"), Rakdos, Lord of Riots (big, nearly free spells, black and red, Moxfield list), The Vision (colorless artifacts, Urza lands and Eldrazi, TappedOut list "Weight of the World"), Dark Leo & Shredder (Ninjas and ninjutsu, white and black, Moxfield list "I Am Ninja, Sneaking in the Shadows"), The Ur-Sphinx (Sphinxes, free spells taken from the opponents and extra turns, Esper, Moxfield list "Stolen Futures"), Vivi Ornitier (cEDH storm, blue and red, Moxfield list "Vivi Ornitier Storm [TOODEEP]"), Sephiroth (aristocrats and combo, mono-black, Moxfield list "Sephiroth's Singularity"), Mario & Luigi (two partner commanders, Bruse Tarl and Reyhan, +1/+1 counters in four colors, Archidekt list), Tevesh Szat & Jeska (two partner commanders, Demons and reanimation, black and red, Moxfield list "Tevesh Szat + Jeska - My Demonic Signature Deck"), and five official precons: Multiverse Reforged (Jace, Multiverse Architect, Reality Fracture), Turtle Power! (Heroes in a Half Shell, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles), Counter Blitz (Tidus, Yuna's Guardian, Final Fantasy X), The Fantastic Four (Invisible Woman, Marvel Super Heroes) and Mutant Menace (The Wise Mothman, Fallout, with rad counters). Cards arrive deck by deck: those missing from the catalog form the "Commander" pseudo-set (EDH, 834 / 834 cards handled, `docs/extensions/edh.md`). To add a deck: list in `docs/commander/decks/`, `npm run import-cards -- edh`, scripts and tests, precon (recipe in CLAUDE.md).

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:5173
```

### Playing online (2 to 4 players)

- **In development:** `npm run server` (game server, port 8787) and `npm run dev`. Open two tabs, then "Against a player": one creates the game, the other joins with the code or the link.
- **Rooms:** Standard, Unlimited or Commander format; 2 to 4 seats, each held by a player or by a server AI (the game starts when all human seats are taken). With several players, a player who leaves concedes and the game goes on without them.
- **On a local network:** `npm run build` then `npm run server`. The server also serves the interface: your opponent opens the displayed "network" address (`http://<ip>:8787`).
- **On a server (Internet, HTTPS):** Node + pm2 behind nginx, with a subdomain. The step-by-step guide is in [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md); the files are in `deploy/` (pm2 configuration, nginx site, update script).
- **Best-of-three match (BO3, duels only):** tick it when creating the room (and, against the AI, on the home screen). Between two games, each player adjusts their deck with their sideboard (same cards in total, legal deck), then the loser of the previous game starts the next one. The match stops at two wins.
- **Room rules:**
  - 60 s per decision, with a rope shown during the last 20;
  - on expiry, a default decision is played; 3 expirations count as a loss;
  - after a disconnection, 60 s to come back (by reloading the page), otherwise a loss;
  - rematch possible in the same room.
- **Environment variables:** `PORT`, `HOST` (`127.0.0.1` behind nginx), `MTGX_DECISION_MS`, `MTGX_GRACE_MS`, `MTGX_MAX_ROOMS`, `MTGX_DATA_DIR` (game saves, resumed after a restart; `data/rooms` by default), `MTGX_MAX_ROOMS_PER_IP` (4), `MTGX_ORIGINS` (origins allowed for the WebSocket besides the site itself), `MTGX_MAX_HEAP_MB`; AI seats: `MTGX_AI_WORKERS` (2), `MTGX_MAX_AI_ROOMS` (12), `MTGX_MAX_RSS_MB` (640). `/healthz` reports the server state (details in [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md)).

### Replays and game export

- **Export the game** (sidebar) downloads a JSON file: the seed, the decks and all the decisions. Since the engine is deterministic, this file is enough to replay the game exactly; attach it to a bug report. Against the AI, export is possible at any time; online, only once the game is over (the file reveals the decks).
- **Review a game** (home screen) opens this file in the viewer: step by step, automatic playback, jump to the start or the end, and choice of point of view (each player sees only what they saw).
- **Online,** games are saved the same way by the server (`data/rooms`): a restart no longer cuts them off.
- **Rules version:** the record notes the engine's rules version and a fingerprint of the game every 25 decisions. A game recorded by an earlier engine version that no longer replays identically stops at the first divergence, shown in the viewer's bar.

### Tablet and phone

The interface adapts to the screen: tablet in landscape or portrait, phone in landscape. In portrait, a phone shows "Rotate your device".

- **The hand** tightens to always fit the width of the screen. On a phone, it extends below the screen, as in MTG Arena.
- **By finger:**
  - a first tap raises a card in hand and enlarges it, a second plays it; you can also drag it to the battlefield;
  - a long press on any card shows it large, and a tap closes it.
- **Narrow screen** (under 1100 px, for example a tablet in portrait): the settings and the log move into a drawer opened by the ☰ button.
- **Trying on a real device:** `npm run dev -- --host`, then open the displayed "Network" address from the tablet (same Wi-Fi network).

### Images blocked by the network

Card images come from Scryfall (`cards.scryfall.io`). Some networks (company, school) block it, and cards are then displayed as a text frame. The Planecircle server can relay the images through `/scry/…`:

- **Automatic:** at startup, if Scryfall does not answer and the server does, the relay turns on by itself.
- **By hand:** the **"Images through the Planecircle server"** checkbox, on the home screen (top right) or in the game settings. Tick it if cards do not show. The choice is remembered.
- **Server:** only card images are relayed (allow list); it is not an open proxy. Behind nginx, the images are cached (see [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md)). In dev, Vite relays `/scry` directly.
- If Scryfall is reachable, images come straight from Scryfall, and the server is not used.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `npm run verify -- --set <EXT>` | Parallel check of a batch (about 2 min): types, Biome, coverage, all tests, targeted fuzz on the set at 2, 3 and 4 players; interface tests if the client changed. `--set COMMANDER`: the Commander precons; `--set EDH`: the Commander pseudo-set |

| `npm test` | Rules and AI tests, and a smoke test of every handled card (Vitest, one file per set) |
| `npm run golden [-- --update]` | Golden games (`tools/golden.ts`): checks that they replay identically; `--update` regenerates only those that diverge after a `RULES_VERSION` change |
| `npm run fuzz -- --games 300 [--pool decks\|all\|meta\|<EXT>\|commander] [--format commander] [--players 4] [--offers 4] [--ai random\|heuristic\|mixed\|beginner\|medium\|expert\|levels\|chaos] [--seed N] [--jobs 10]` | AI-versus-AI games, invariants checked at every decision. `--pool FIN`: decks drawn mostly from that set. `--format commander`: Commander games (random decks, or `--pool commander`: the precons). `--offers N`: strict fuzz (every offered option must be accepted). `--jobs`: games spread over several processes, same results for the same seed |
| `npm run bench` | Engine decisions per second and AI decision time (targets: ≥ 5,000 dec/s, medium AI < 50 ms, high AI < 150 ms; measure on mains power) |

```

- **`submit(state, player, decision) → { state, events }`**: the engine advances on its own up to the next decision. It then gives the exhaustive list of legal options (`legalActions`), used by the interface, the AI and the autopilot.
- **Autopilot** (`engine/src/autopilot.ts`): it answers trivial decisions. The engine itself stays strict. "Full control" mode disables the autopilot, except "End turn", which remains an explicit request. During your turn, it always stops at the second main phase: you end the turn yourself. Real decisions (commander returning to the command zone…) are never taken for you.
- **Card effects**: they are serializable data (`engine/src/dsl.ts`), never code stored in the state.
- **Rule 400.7**: an object that changes zone gets a new identifier (`id`). The `uid` identifier follows the physical card for animations.
- **N players**: priority in turn order, APNAP order, one defender per attacker (player or planeswalker), player elimination (800.4a), free mulligan with three or more players.
- **Commander** (903): commanders designated by their physical identity, command zone (tax, eminence), return offered to the owner, commander damage, color identity.
- **Loops** (104.4b): a loop of mandatory actions is a draw, including a loop that accumulates tokens or triggers.
- **Generic choices** (`choices.ts`): every question goes through a `ChoiceRequest` (choose, order, yes/no, number, distribute) with a suggested answer. A resolution can be suspended on a choice and then resumed; intermediate values ("if you do") are remembered in the resolution.
- **Triggered abilities** (`triggers.ts`):
  - detected at the moment of the event, with look-back for simultaneous deaths;
  - put on the stack in APNAP order;
  - "if…" conditions are rechecked on resolution;
  - also handled: modal abilities, "once per turn", delayed and reflexive abilities, and emblems.
- **Layers** (`layers.ts`):
  - characteristics computed layer by layer (4 to 7): types, colors, granted or lost abilities, P/T;
  - static abilities, including on "the equipped or enchanted creature";
  - result cached by state version; the fuzz checks the cache.
- **Stack**: targetable spells and abilities, counterspells, ward, "can't be countered".
- **Attachments**: Auras (targeted on casting), Equipment ("Equip" read from the text), state-based actions 704.5m–n.
- **Planeswalkers**: loyalty, loyalty abilities (one per turn), planeswalker attacks, emblems.
- **Replacements and prevention** (`replacement.ts`) and **costs** (`mana.ts`, `stack.ts`):
  - replacements: exile instead of dying, entering tapped or with counters (including imposed by another permanent), prevention;
  - numeric event replacements as data (`eventReplacement`, 616.1): damage, life loss and gain, draw, mill, counters, tokens, mana and untap ("plus N more", "twice that many", prevention, "the next time" shields), in the order most favorable to the affected player;
  - costs: hybrid, additional costs, flashback, reductions, sacrifice or counters as a cost, activation from the graveyard.
- **Multi-faced cards**: adventures and omens, double-faced cards (transform, modal faces, Sagas on the back), split cards and Rooms, meld; Sagas, Classes and Cases; face-down cards (disguise, cloak, manifest), hidden from the opponent.
- **Set mechanics**: among others, prepare (FRA), warp and station (EOE), speed, exhaust and Vehicles (DFT), plot, spree and crimes (OTJ), job select and tiered (FIN), Rooms, manifest dread, Eerie, Survival, Delirium and Impending (DSK), Offspring, Gift, Forage, Expend, Valiant and Seasons (BLB), endure, flurry, renew and omens (TDM), blight, Vivid, changeling, behold, wither and conspire (ECL), eminence, myriad, annihilator, delve, casualty and secretly chosen numbers (Commander), Roles, Celebration, Adventures and Bargain (WOE), Repartee, Infusion, Opus, Increment, cascade and miracle (SOS), suspect, disguise, cloak and collect evidence (MKM), waterbending, earthbending, firebending and airbending, and omens (TLA), power-up, teamwork, improvise and shield counters (MSH), Web-slinging, chaos, riot and modified creatures (SPM), sneak attack, Mutagen, Alliance and Vanishing (TMT), Storied, recruit and sharpening counters (HOB). The details per set are in `docs/extensions/`.
- **Performance**: `submit` copies the state then mutates it (no Immer); AI simulations use `applyMutable` on a working copy.

## Adding a card

A card's characteristics (cost, types, P/T, keywords, loyalty, ward, "Equip", cycling, Saga chapters…) come from Scryfall. A "vanilla" or "french vanilla" creature therefore works without a script. Otherwise, its behavior is described in `packages/cards/src/<ext>/*.ts`:

```ts
"Burst Lightning": { kicker: "{4}", spell: spell([target.any()], [fx.damage(amount.kicked(4, 2), ref.target())]) },
```

Every handled card is played automatically by the smoke test (`packages/ai/test/smoke/`, one file per set). New mechanics also get a rules test (`packages/engine/test/<ext>.test.ts`). For a mechanic the engine lacks, `docs/engine.md` says where to touch.

**Adding a set:**
1. `npm run coverage -- --set <EXT> --text` gives the texts of the remaining cards.
2. Write the scripts in batches (A: simple cards; B: flagship mechanics; C and following: unique cards), with `npm run verify -- --set <EXT>` then one commit per batch. Each batch adds its rules tests (`engine/test/<ext>.test.ts`) and follows the rules of CLAUDE.md (no new single-card flag, replacements through `eventReplacement`).
3. Finish with `npm run verify -- --full`.
