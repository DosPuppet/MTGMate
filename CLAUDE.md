# CLAUDE.md — tracking and conventions for Planecircle (MTGX)

This file tracks the project between sessions: current state, working rules, pitfalls. The README presents the project; the history is in `docs/history.md`; open items are in `docs/backlog.md`; the rest is in `docs/` (see "Documents").

## Goal and scope

- MTG platform against the AI and online (2 to 4 players, BO3 in duels; Commander), home-grown rules engine in TypeScript, fluid MTG Arena-style interface.
- **Scope: the Standard format.** Legal and banned sets: see the README; recheck at each rotation (Scryfall `legal:standard` / `banned:standard`).
- **Commander (PLAN-E, done 2026-10-06):** format rules, 2 to 4 players, against the AI and online (AI seats included); sixteen playable precons (Edgar Markov, Y'shtola, The Ur-Dragon, Rakdos, Lord of Riots, Multiverse Reforged, Turtle Power!, Counter Blitz, The Fantastic Four, Mutant Menace, The Vision, Dark Leo & Shredder, The Ur-Sphinx, Vivi Ornitier, Sephiroth, Mario & Luigi, Tevesh Szat & Jeska; partner pairs); cards arrive deck by deck (pseudo-set `EDH`, `docs/commander/decks/`, recipe below).
- Out of scope: Limited, eternal formats, Alchemy.

## State (2026-10-02)

- **All of Standard is playable:** 5,164 / 5,164 cards, 19 sets (5,177 cards imported, 13 of them banned; legalities compared every week against Scryfall, `tools/check-legality.ts`). Detail per set: `docs/extensions/<ext>.md`; milestones and chronology: `docs/history.md`.
- **Platform:** three-level AI, online play for 2 to 4 players with AI seats (BO3 in duels, rope, reconnection, resume after restart), Commander, 9-lesson tutorial, replays, game resume when the page is reopened, tablet and phone, pm2 + nginx deployment.
- **Plans:** `docs/plans/PLAN-L.md` (backlog pass: everything doable without a user decision, lots L0 to L12, done 2026-10-09, rules 185 -> 193); `docs/plans/PLAN-J.md` (debt and approximations pass after the Commander decks, lots J0 to J7, done 2026-10-09, rules 178 -> 185); `docs/plans/PLAN-I.md` (bilingual application, code and documents in English; batches I0 to I7, done 2026-10-08). Plans A, C, D, E, G, H, P4, R and S are done and condensed into `docs/history.md` (what was done, summaries, rules versions); what is still open (deferred rules of PLAN-R "Deferred until a card requires it", reports and leftovers of each plan, among them C13 on a continuing basis: sets before R7 and TDM at 50% of tested cards, `npm run coverage -- --set all --tests`, and the undone parts of C12 and C18) is in `docs/backlog.md`.
- **Branch `dev`** for current work (`master` = stable version). Batches are done at the user's request, one commit per batch or sub-batch.
- Splitting a set (at the next rotation): batch A (cards doable with the engine, tokens, lands), batch B (flagship mechanics), batches C and following (unique cards); one commit per batch; `npm run verify -- --set <EXT>`.

## Documents

- `docs/plans/PLAN-L.md`: backlog pass (2026-10-09), lots L0 to L12, done; tracking and summary at the end of the document, summary in `docs/history.md` § 15, what was left in `docs/backlog.md` ("PLAN-L: not done").
- `docs/plans/PLAN-J.md`: debt and approximations pass (2026-10-09), lots J0 to J7, done; tracking at the end of the document, summary in `docs/history.md` § 14, what was left in `docs/backlog.md` ("PLAN-J: not done").
- `docs/plans/PLAN-I.md`: bilingual application, code and documents in English, batches I0 to I7, done 2026-10-08; tracking and summary at the end of the document. The other plans (A, C, D, E, G, H, P4, R, S) no longer exist as files: see `docs/history.md` and `docs/backlog.md`. Meta decks are in `docs/meta/2026-09-29/`.
- `docs/audits/`: **`2026-10-03-cards.md`** (accuracy of M/R/U cards: test coverage, families of approximations, options; batches K0 to K8 done 2026-10-03, balance sheet and reports at the end of the document); **`2026-10-02.md`** (general audit after the Standard coverage: bugs B1 to B6, choices made in place of the player, approximations, debt, architecture, platform); **`2026-10-07-debt.md`** (debt audit). The earlier audits (2026-09-29, 2026-09-30) are condensed into `docs/history.md`.
- `docs/engine.md`: **read before adding a mechanic.** Map of the engine files, recipes, design rules, ceilings.
- `docs/approximations.md`: known approximations, general then card by card. **Every new approximation is added there**; every approximation lifted is removed from it.
- `docs/extensions/<ext>.md`: mechanics and batches of each set (`core`: cross-cutting batches; `meta`: meta batches; `reprints`: reprint sets). **The detail of a card batch goes there.**
- `docs/history.md`: milestones and chronology of the project, condensed history of the plans.
- `docs/backlog.md`: open items and deferred rules.
- `docs/deployment.md` (pm2, nginx), `docs/tutorial.md` (lessons), `docs/ai.md` (levels, ISMCTS, tournament and measurements).
- Oracle texts: `npm run coverage -- --set <ext> --text [--color W|U|B|R|G|M|C|L]`; one card: `--card "<name>"`; a Commander deck: `--deck <id|all> [--text]`.
- Cards named in a rules test, per set: `npm run coverage -- --set all --tests [--meta]` (to quote in the report of a card batch).
- Oracle ↔ script audit: `npm run coverage -- --set <ext> --audit` (`cards/src/audit.ts`); `cards/test/audit.test.ts` fails on any new gap; an intended gap goes into `cards/data/audit-baseline.json` with its reason.

## Conventions

- **Language (PLAN-I):**
  - code, comments, tests and documents in **English**; `cards/test/english-source.test.ts` fails on French outside `packages/cards/data/french-baseline.json` (`allowed`: files that keep French on purpose, with the reason; `files`: must stay empty); French kept on purpose on one line: `// i18n-ignore: <why>`; `npx tsx tools/french-source.ts [--write] [--lines <file>]`; the user writes in French or English;
  - the interface is **bilingual, French by default**: one setting (`planecircle.lang`, `LangToggle`) for the interface and the cards (name, text, Scryfall image);
  - every player-facing text is English in the source: `msg("…", { args })` in the engine, the cards and the server (`engine/src/text.ts`; cards cited by `cardRef`, as values), `t("…")` / `useT()` in the client (`client/src/translate.ts`, `localize.ts`), always with a string literal; card `label`, `prompt` and `labels` may be plain English literals; a text held in a variable is displayed with `textIn(lang, …)`, or `loc()` / `localizeText` when it may cite cards; never compare a displayed text in code (read data or keys);
  - its French goes into a catalog keyed by the English text: `engine/locales/fr.json`, `server/locales/fr.json`, `cards/locales/fr/<set>.json` (`core.json` for the root of `cards/src`; all listed in `cards/src/locales.ts`), `client/locales/fr.json`; one English id = one French text everywhere (otherwise a more precise English or a `ctx:<word>|` prefix); `npx tsx tools/locales.ts` sorts them (`--merge <dir>` adds fragments); `cards/test/locales.test.ts` fails on a missing, stale or conflicting entry;
  - French keeps the **vouvoiement**, never tutoiement; `tools/lang-smoke.ts` (in `verify`'s interface tests) plays a game in each language and fails on a raw marker, French in English or an untranslated text in French.
- **Engine:**
  - pure and deterministic (seed); effects = serializable data (DSL `engine/src/dsl.ts`), never functions in the state;
  - an illegal decision throws a **`RulesError`**: the AI and the fuzz depend on it, an ordinary `Error` crashes a game;
  - any change that may alter characteristics calls `bump(s)` (layer cache);
  - a new `GameState` field is initialized in `game.ts` and, if needed, in `engine/test/helpers.ts`.
- **Cards:**
  - sets declared in `packages/cards/src/sets.ts`; a reprint keeps the definition of the first set;
  - scripts in `packages/cards/src/<set>/*.ts`; generic DSL and tokens in `fdn/common.ts`;
  - whatever can be read in the Scryfall text (keywords, ward, "Equip", loyalty, Harmony, Bargain…) is deduced in `cards/src/scryfall.ts`;
  - legality: `validateDeck` (format `standard` by default) refuses banned cards, cards outside the format or with no known legality, sideboard included; the `unlimited` format ("Unlimited", chosen on the home screen or when creating an online room, kept in `planecircle.format`) accepts any card of the catalog whatever its legality (banned, outside Standard); only the construction rules remain;
  - Commander (PLAN-E): cards of Commander decks missing from the catalog go in the `EDH` pseudo-set (last in the registry, `byName`), imported by name from `docs/commander/decks/*.txt` (`npm run import-cards -- edh`, then `npm run import-printings`); original printing in `CardDef.origin`; bans, Game Changers and non-legal cards in `cards/data/commander.json` (`npx tsx tools/check-legality.ts --commander [--write]`, weekly CI task).
- **Online play (`packages/server`):**
  - the server is authoritative: it validates the deck and every decision (`RulesError` sent back to the client);
  - a player receives only their view (`projectView`), their filtered events (`filterEvents`) and the faces they know (`visibleFaces`);
  - any new event or view field that may cite a hidden card is filtered; `ai/test/hidden-info.test.ts` checks it;
  - the protocol is in `server/src/protocol.ts`, which the client imports with `import type` (except the `PROTOCOL_VERSION` constant);
  - handshake: creating, joining and resuming a room carry `{ protocol: PROTOCOL_VERSION, rules: RULES_VERSION }`; a client of another version gets the `version` error and reloads the page. Advance `PROTOCOL_VERSION` on any incompatible change to the messages.
- **Cards in French by preference** (unless the user says otherwise): name, text and image; without a French printing in the original set, use that of another set (`import-cards -- edh` does it; Scryfall has French printings with English text, EOC: to be discarded); without any French text at Scryfall (old printings), text completed by hand in `cards/data/french-overrides.json`, applied by the import by name. Report the cards that do not exist in French.
- **Data:** `packages/cards/data/fdn.json` is indented with **1 space** (rewrite it identically); reimport: `npm run import-cards -- <set>|all` (`all` excludes FDN and FRA, touched up by hand; their missing French data: `npx tsx tools/import-french.ts <set>`). List of sets: `cards/src/setRegistry.ts` (the only source, read by the import tools). Printings table (illustrations of your choice in the deck editor, loaded on demand, checked by the server): `npm run import-printings`, to rerun after a reimport. Ban announced before a reimport: `cards/data/legality-overrides.json`; the README list of banned cards is checked by `cards/test/legality.test.ts`.
- **Commits:** only when the user asks; message in English, ending with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`; remote `origin` (github.com/DosPuppet/planecircle): the user pushes.

## Checks before handing in a batch

- **Per batch:** `npm run verify -- --set <EXT>` (about 2 min; `--set META` for the meta decks): `tsc`, Biome, coverage, bundle budget (`tools/bundle-size.ts`: client build, size of each chunk, no card in the worker); vitest (smoke test per set); targeted fuzz at 2, 3 and 4 players, mixed AI and "chaos"; fuzz on the whole pool; interface tests only if the client, `view.ts` or the protocol changed (`--ui` to force them; Vite must be running).
- **At the end of a series or before a merge:** `npm run verify -- --full` (about 7 min): three seeds on the whole pool, 3 and 4 players, mixed AI, bench, interface tests (including `tutorial-smoke`, `lang-smoke` and `ai-smoke`).
- **Result:** one line per step with its duration; detail only on failure; logs in `test-results/verify/`.
- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): `verify --ci` on every push to `dev` or `master` and on every pull request; `verify --full --no-ui --no-bench` every night.
- **Fuzz by hand:** `npm run fuzz -- --games 300 --pool FIN --jobs 10`; identical results for the same seed, whatever `--jobs`.
- **Invariants** (`checkInvariants`, `ai/src/selfplay.ts`): they run at every decision of the fuzz and the smoke test; a single pass over the objects, no `JSON.stringify` or state copy without need; tested in `ai/test/invariants.test.ts`.
- **[rules] batch** (it changes engine behavior): advance `RULES_VERSION` (`engine/src/record.ts`, history line). Golden games (`tools/golden.ts`, `ai/test/golden/`) that replay identically stay as they are; `npm run golden -- --update` regenerates only those that diverge, and the commit says which. `ai/test/golden.test.ts` fails on any divergence (at equal version: the engine changed without advancing the version).
- **Strict fuzz** (`--offers N`): every N priorities, each option of `legalActions`, with its default choices, must be accepted by the engine (`checkOffers`, `ai/src/selfplay.ts`). An option offered then refused is a disagreement between `legal.ts` and `stack.ts`: fix one or the other, and add a test to `engine/test/offers.test.ts`.
- **New visible mechanic:** a one-off Playwright script, with screenshots in `test-results/`.
- **Bench and `ai-smoke`:** reliable only on mains power; the machine (WSL, adjustable CPU) varies a lot: compare before and after (`git stash`), never against an old figure; a narrow `ai-smoke` failure ("slowed 4x") at the end of `--full` is rerun alone before concluding.

## Known pitfalls

- **Bundle:** card data in a separate chunk (`cards-*.js`, `client/vite.config.ts`; French catalogs in `locales-*.js`), card scripts in the application chunk (`index-*.js`, about 1.8 MB); budgets in `tools/bundle-size.ts`; the server compresses (brotli or gzip) and caches `/assets/` for a year; a service worker (`client/public/sw.js`) allows offline play. The worker must not import `@mtgx/cards` (it receives its definitions in `start`); only `@mtgx/cards/tokens` is allowed. Slow first load in dev: rerun an interface test that fails on a timeout right after a Vite restart.
- **Vite under WSL:** it may serve a stale version of an engine module. Restart `npm run dev` before any browser test.
- **Battlefield (`client/src/board/layout.ts`):** layout in pure TypeScript, tested (`layout.test.ts`); each side sized independently; placement by type after MTGA (`battlefield-smoke` checks it); spacing constants aligned with `styles.css`; bounded column (`minmax(0, 1fr)`); look for an object on screen with `findObjectEl` (not every token of a stack has an element); cards exiled by a permanent (`view.exiledWith`) stacked behind it; cards playable from outside the hand (`view.playableElsewhere`) at the end of the hand; modified cost as a badge (`ObjectView.castCost`).
- **Tablet and phone:** heights in `dvh`, never `100vh`; `fitHand` tightens the hand; touch in `client/src/touch.ts` (long press = preview, first tap raises the card); drawer under 1100 px; "Turn your device to landscape" in portrait under 600 px; `mobile-smoke` emulates the devices, but test the address bar on a real device (`npm run dev -- --host`).
- **Scryfall images:** every URL goes through `imageUrl` (`client/src/images.ts`); a component that displays an image calls `useRelayActive()`; the server's `/scry/` route accepts only card images (allow list `SCRY_PATH`): never widen it. Personal illustrations: `npm run custom-art -- <folder>=<set> [<folder>=<set>…]` prepares `data/art/` (outside Git) from all the folders together, one art set per proxy deck (today `npm run custom-art -- /home/dospu/Nier_cards=nier /home/dospu/MarioLuigi_cards=mario`: the files missing from the given folders are deleted), served on `/art/` by the server and by Vite; it is a printing like any other ("custom:<set>": only that set's images, its tokens and card back included; plain "custom": the shared images, the first folder winning; "Illustration" menu of the editor, one choice per set; The Vision precon with `"art": "custom:nier"`, Mario & Luigi with `"art": "custom:mario"`): the view marks the face (`customArt`, also the tokens and the back of a player who uses it), `faceImage` looks for the image by name ("Personal illustrations" checkbox).
- **Sounds (`client/src/audio/`):** `sounds.ts` (file table), `eventSounds.ts` (events → sounds, tested), `sfx.ts`; unlocked at the first gesture; a new engine event has no sound until it is in `soundsFor`.
- **Game server:** `npm run server` (tsx, for development) loads the engine at startup (restart it after a change to the engine or the cards) and serves `packages/client/dist` (rerun `npm run build`). In production, pm2 runs the compiled server `packages/server/dist/main.mjs` (`npm run build:server`, esbuild). `/healthz` details versions, memory and rooms for a direct local request only. A room takes 0.2 to 0.3 MB of heap; beyond `maxHeapMb`, no room is created (`tools/load-test.ts`). Before a [rules] deployment: `npx tsx tools/rooms-check.ts` (run by `deploy/update.sh`).
- **Deployment (the user's VPS):** shared machine, existing nginx, **no Docker, no Caddy, no systemd unit**: pm2 (`deploy/ecosystem.config.cjs`), server on `127.0.0.1`. Games in progress are saved (`data/rooms`, files in 600, tokens and addresses as SHA-256 fingerprints) and resumed at startup by replaying their decisions; a rules change may make a save impossible to replay (file set aside, deleted after seven days). `deploy/update.sh` backs up `data/rooms` before each update (rollback: `docs/deployment.md`).
- **Resume on reopening (`client/src/savedGame.ts`):** game against the AI written to `localStorage` (`planecircle.localGame`) by `SaveWriter`, replayed by the worker on opening; online game resumed by its token (`planecircle.online`), otherwise message and home screen; a `?room=` link takes precedence.
- **Saved settings** in `localStorage` (`planecircle.autopilot`, `planecircle.lang`, `planecircle.board`). "End turn" is a soft pass; Shift+Enter, a hard pass. The automation always stops at the second main phase of its own turn (empty stack), even with nothing to do: the player ends the turn themselves (`autopilot.ts`).
- **`undoMana`** is not an option of `legalActions` (the random AI would loop): the view marks the sources that can be undone.
- **Dev mode only:** `window.__mtgx` (sandbox: `startGame(deck, decksIA, { p1: { cards, tokens } })`) and `window.__sfxLog`; not in the production build. In `page.evaluate`, no named function (tsx injects `__name`).
- **Fast test mode (`?fast`):** the AI plays without pauses. Interface scripts open `/?fast`, except `battlefield-smoke`. A test loop that plays a game handles the choice windows and discarding, and fails if the game gets stuck.
- **Tutorial (`client/src/tutorial/`):** replayed by `client/test/tutorial.test.ts` and `tutorial-smoke`. Changing a lesson, a card it uses, the automation or the options of `legalActions` may block it: rerun both. Every decision goes through `store.decide` or `store.endTurn` (guidance guard).
- **AI (`packages/ai`):** never read the opponent's hand, their deck, the order of libraries or hidden faces (`determinize`, `ismcts.test.ts`); in a simulation, apply decisions with `step`, not `applyMutable`; time budget in the interface, iterations elsewhere; judge a change by tournament (`npm run arena`, 600 games or more).
- **Game pacing:** the host (`frames` option) sends one update per stack step; the client plays them in order (`playback`, `store.ts`); during playback, `decide` is ignored.
- **Mulligans (103.5):** table turn by table turn; a test script must not assume the order.
- **Smoke test (`ai/test/smoke/`):** a card not played fails the test; a new set gets its file and enters `OWN_FILES`; for a reactive card, the opponent must have spells.
- **Characteristics cache:** anything a static ability or a variable P/T depends on advances the version (`bump`); the fuzz detects omissions.
- **Biome:** `npx biome check . | tail -1` hides errors (grep "Found"); a `*/` in a JSDoc comment closes it. Biome reformats: prefer a whitespace-tolerant patch.
- **Vitest 5.0.1 and `/tmp`:** each run creates `/tmp/<nanoid>/ssr` (about 60 MB) without deleting it; the `mtgx-clear-vitest-tmp` plugin in `vitest.config.ts` deletes it on close (without it, `/tmp` filled up on 2026-10-02). Remove it when vitest does it itself.
- **`pgrep -f` / `pkill -f`** with a pattern present in the command line may kill the current shell.

## Adding a Commander deck (PLAN-E)

1. Deck list in `docs/commander/decks/<id>.txt` ("// Name — description", section `Commander`, then `Deck`; 100 cards; source and date in a comment).
2. `npm run import-cards -- edh` (cards missing from the catalog, original printing, French text), then `npm run import-printings` (printings; it also compares the color identity against Scryfall).
3. `npm run coverage -- --deck <id> --text`: cards to script; new mechanics first (generic forms), then the cards in `packages/cards/src/edh/<file>.ts`, rules tests in `packages/engine/test/edh*.test.ts`.
4. Precon `packages/cards/decks/cmd-<id>.json` (registered in `decks.ts`), identical to the list (`cards/test/commander-decks.test.ts`); it becomes playable when all its cards are (`commanderPlayable` list of `decklist.test.ts`).
5. Balance: `npm run arena -- --a medium --b medium --format commander --pool commander --by-deck --deck cmd-<id> --games 600` (at 2 then `--players 4`) against the other precons (by default on all cores minus two, games dealt out one by one; progress every 10 s; the report quotes the five slowest decisions and the command that replays their game); `npm run verify -- --set COMMANDER`.

## Rule: no single-card debt

- **Look for a generic form first** before adding, for a single card, a field, a union member, an effect operation or a state field: family parameterized by an `ObjectFilter` (`BlockRule`, `ProtectionRule`, `playFrom`, `abilityCost`, `castLimit`, `triggerMod`…), turn log (`amount.turnEvents`) rather than a "this turn" field, effects on players (`fx.thisTurn`), existing effect or trigger.
- **If a card truly requires it,** the addition is justified in `packages/cards/data/debt-baseline.json` (reason, target family) and flagged in the batch.
- **`packages/cards/test/debt.test.ts` checks it** and fails on any new or stale entry: player flags, unprinted keywords, operations, union variants (Condition, Amount, Ref, TriggerSpec) and properties of a single card, "this turn" fields of `GameObject`, card names in engine code; values of closed unions written by a single card are tracked by a ceiling ("Values specific to one card"). It also tracks the size of the model surfaces (`ceilings`) and the largest import cycle of the engine (`importCycleMax`): raising them must be justified in the batch, lowering them is mandatory as soon as they go down (`npx tsx tools/debt-ceilings.ts [--write "reason"]`, reason noted in `ceilingNotes`). Up-to-date figures: the reference itself.

## Adding cards: replacements (R1) and accuracy (R7)

**Replacements and prevention (616, 615):**
- A modified number (damage, counters, life, draw) goes through `modifiers.ts` (`AmountMod`, `chooseReplacementOrder`) in `dealDamage`, `changeCounters`, `gainLife` or `drawCards`; never a fixed order, never a draw that bypasses `drawCards`.
- A replacement is written with `eventReplacement({ event: "damage" | "lifeLoss" | "tokens" | "counters" | "lifeGain" | "draw" | "mill" | "mana" | "untap", … })` (printed ability) or `fx.thisTurn({ replacement })` (effect); "the next time" shield (615.7): `fx.shield(…)`.
- Before implementing a deferred rule, reread "Deferred until a card requires it" in `docs/backlog.md` (deferred rules of the former PLAN-R).

**Card accuracy:**
- **One rules-test file per set** (`packages/engine/test/<ext>.test.ts`), which checks the Oracle text, not just that the card can be played. Models: `ecl.test.ts`, `mkm.test.ts`; shared helpers in `engine/test/helpers.ts`.
- **Official rulings:** a delicate interaction (copies, replacements, lifelink, layers…) gets a test taken from the Scryfall rulings in `engine/test/rulings.test.ts`.
- **Oracle expectations:** a recurring text form gets its pattern in `cards/test/oracle-expectations.test.ts` (`clause`).
- **Gap found:** fix the engine or the script; otherwise, a documented approximation. Never write a test that freezes wrong behavior.
- **Batch report:** number of tests added, gaps found.
