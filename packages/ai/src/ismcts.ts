/**
 * ISMCTS (Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search) for the priority decisions of the expert level, in a duel.
 *
 * The AI sees neither the opponent's hand, nor their decklist, nor the order of the libraries. At each iteration, a
 * **determinization** is drawn: the opponent's hidden cards are drawn from what was seen of them (`determinize`). One of the root options is then played (chosen by
 * UCB1, with a bias toward the options the one-move evaluation prefers), then a fast simulation (policy.ts)
 * until the start of the AI's next turn, and the resulting position is evaluated.
 *
 * The tree is limited to the root (the AI's options at this decision): with a few tens to a few hundred
 * iterations, deeper nodes would be visited too rarely to be reliable.
