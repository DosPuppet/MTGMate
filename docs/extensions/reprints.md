# Reprints playable in "Unlimited" (PLAN-G)

Eight reprint sets released alongside the Standard sets: Special Guests (SPG), Stellar Sights (EOS), Enchanting Tales
(WOT), Breaking News (OTP), Through the Ages (FCA), Mystical Archive (SOA), Source Material (PZA) and Jurassic World
Collection (REX). Outside Standard, they serve the "Unlimited" format. Plan: PLAN-G (condensed in `docs/history.md`).

The scripts are in `packages/cards/src/<code>/cards.ts` (helpers: `tdm/common.ts`); the rules tests in
`packages/engine/test/<code>.test.ts`; the smoke tests in `packages/ai/test/smoke/<code>.test.ts`.

## G1 — printings ✅

A card already in the app and reprinted by one of these sets gets a printing (`CardDef.printings`): the deck can choose
its artwork (51 cards). Details in the plan's follow-up.

## G2a — alternative costs and modes ✅

| Mechanic | Form | Cards |
|---|---|---|
| Overload (702.96) | `altCostMode("Overload", cost, normal, overloaded)`: `ModeDef.cost` | Cyclonic Rift, Winds of Abandon (SOA), Mizzix's Mastery (FCA) |
| Fuse (702.148) | `altCostMode("Fuse", …)` | Fierce Retribution (OTP) |
| Escalate (702.120) | `escalate(cost, …modes)` | Collective Defiance (OTP) |
| Dash (702.109) | read from the text: `altCost.via = "dash"`, haste and return to hand | Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer (FCA) |
| Spectacle (702.137) | read from the text: `altCost` if an opponent lost life this turn | Light Up the Stage (FCA), Skewer the Critics (OTP) |

- **The engine gains:** `ModeDef.cost` (a mode cast for its own cost, offered only if payable, never free nor with
  another alternative cost); `altCost.via`; the search done by other players reads its number from each player's point
  of view (Winds of Abandon overloaded: as many lands as the number of one's creatures exiled).
- **Tests:** `soa.test.ts` (5), `fca.test.ts` (5), `otp.test.ts` (6). Approximations: Ragavan (permission to play),
  Winds of Abandon (the owner searches).
- **Deferred to their own lot:** emerge (Cresting Mosasaurus, REX), madness (Terminal Agony, OTP), replicate (Consign to
  Memory, SPG), retrace (Waves of Aggression, PZA): one card each.

## G2b — permanent keywords ✅

| Mechanic | Form | Cards |
|---|---|---|
| Exalted (702.83) | read from the text: `attacksAlone`, +1/+1 | Cathedral of War (EOS) |
| Affinity for artifacts (702.41) | read from the text: `costReduction` | Frogmite, Thoughtcast (SPG) |
| Metalcraft | script: two `fx.when` on resolution | Galvanic Blast (SPG) |
| Modular (702.43) | read from the text: `entersWith` and counters (last known information) on a targeted artifact creature | Arcbound Ravager (PZA), Power Depot (EOS) |
| Graft (702.58) | read from the text: `entersWith`, optional counter move | Cytoplast Manipulator (PZA) |
| Imprint | `exileFromHandLinked` and mana of the linked colors | Chrome Mox (SPG) |
| Extort (702.101) | read from the text: `castSpell` and `mayPay("{W/B}")` | Blind Obedience (WOT); The Kingpin of Crime (MSH) no longer writes its own |
| Shroud (702.18) | keyword `shroud` | Helix Pinnacle (SPG) |
| Champion (702.72) | `champion` helper (`spg/cards.ts`): `chooseAmong`, `exileUntilLeaves`, sacrifice otherwise | Mistbind Clique, Wanderwine Prophets (SPG) |

- **Tests:** `spg.test.ts` (8), `eos.test.ts` (3), `pza.test.ts` (3), `wot.test.ts` (2); smoke EOS, PZA, WOT.
- **Audit:** Mistbind Clique, "when a Faerie is championed" read as a static ability (intended gap, `audit-baseline.json`).
- **Deferred to their own lot (one card each):** monstrosity and bloodthirst (REX), regeneration (Swarmyard, G3), boast
  (Varragoth, FCA), populate (Life Finds a Way, REX), council's dilemma (Expropriate, SPG), Dino DNA (REX).

## G2c — storm ✅

- **Storm (702.40)** read from the text: `castSelf` then `copySpell(self, amount.eventAmount)`. The number of spells cast
  before it this turn, by all players, is fixed at cast time (`RulesEvent` `cast.spellsBefore`). Stormscale Scion (TDM)
  no longer writes its own, which counted on resolution and only your spells.
- **Cards:** Brain Freeze, Empty the Warrens, Flusterstorm (SOA). Tests: `soa.test.ts` (+2).

## G3a — Stellar Sights, feasible lands ✅ (35 / 43)

- **Cards (33):** Ancient Tomb, Blinkmoth Nexus, Bonders' Enclave, Cascading Cataracts, Celestial Colonnade, Contested
  War Zone, Creeping Tar Pit, Crystal Quarry, Deserted Temple, Dust Bowl, Eldrazi Temple, Endless Sands, Grove of the
  Burnwillows, High Market, Hissing Quagmire, Inventors' Fair, Lavaclaw Reaches, Lotus Field, Lumbering Falls, Mana
  Confluence, Mirrorpool, Mutavault, Mystifying Maze, Needle Spires, Petrified Field, Raging Ravine, Scavenger Grounds,
  Shambling Vent, Stirring Wildwood, Strip Mine, Terrain Generator, Thespian's Stage, Wandering Fumarole.
- **Forms:** `manland` helper (Elemental creature-lands from Worldwake and Oath of the Gatewatch); drawback of a mana
  ability (`drawback`, new); Thespian's Stage keeps its ability (`becomeCopy`, `keepAbilities`); Wandering Fumarole is
  the first card to switch P/T (`switchPT`, 613.4d).
- **Tests:** `eos.test.ts` (+12).
- **Approximation:** Eldrazi Temple, the restricted mana applies to any Eldrazi spell or ability (colorless or not).

## G3b — Stellar Sights, lands that needed engine work ✅ (43 / 43)

| Card | New form |
|---|---|
| Inkmoth Nexus | infect keyword (702.90) |
| Swarmyard | regeneration (701.19): `fx.regenerate`, shield consumed by `destroy`, removed at cleanup |
| Meteor Crater, Plaza of Heroes | mana of the colors of your permanents (`colorsOf`) |
| Reflecting Pool | mana of the types your other lands could produce (`likeLands`) |
| Blast Zone | filter `compare: [cmp.manaValue("=", amount.lkiCounters("charge"))]` (mana value equal to the source's counters, last known information after the sacrifice) |
| Nesting Grounds | `moveCounter` effect (kind of one's choice) |
| Gemstone Caverns | conditional `leyline`: if you are not the starting player, with a luck counter, a card exiled from hand |

- **Tests:** `eos.test.ts` (+8).
- **Approximations:** Gemstone Caverns automatically exiles the non-land card of lowest mana value; Reflecting Pool does
  not see what other Reflecting Pools would produce.
