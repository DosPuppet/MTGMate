# Standard meta (plan P4, phase 1)

Cards from the most played Standard decks, across all sets, before the complete set-by-set coverage (PLAN-P4, condensed in `docs/history.md`). The decks surveyed are in `docs/meta/2026-09-29/`. Each lot makes a few archetypes playable, main deck **and** sideboard (BO3 needs it).

Checking a lot: `npm run verify -- --set META`. The targeted fuzz then plays the already playable meta decks against each other (`npm run fuzz -- --pool meta`), and the test `cards/test/meta-decks.test.ts` checks that the decks of the finished lots are legal and playable.

Scripts go in their set's folder (`packages/cards/src/<ext>/cards.ts`, one file per set while it is partial). They will be split by color once the set is fully covered.

## Lot M1 — Izzet Spellementals and Mono-Green Landfall (28.9% of the meta)

22 cards: 17 from the main decks, 5 from the sideboards. Rules tests in `engine/test/meta.test.ts`.

### Engine

- **Harmonize** (702.180, Tarkir: Dragonstorm):
  - read from the text (`scryfall.ts`): the harmonize cost is stored in `CardDef.flashback`, with `CardDef.harmonize`. The card is therefore cast from the graveyard like a flashback, then exiled;
  - you may tap an untapped creature you control to reduce the generic part by its power: `CastChoices.tap` (at most one creature), offered by `additional.tap` of the cast option (`harmonizeOptions`, `stack.ts`);
  - without `tap` in the decision (AI, autopilot), the default choice applies: the smallest power that covers all the generic cost, otherwise the largest; `tap: []` taps nothing;
  - `legalActions` counts the possible reduction to know whether the spell is payable.
- **Bargain** (702.166, Wilds of Eldraine): read from the Scryfall keywords, it is a {0} kicker "sacrifice an artifact, an enchantment or a token" (`kickerKind: "bargain"`, question "Bargain").
- **Kicker with no mana, chosen by the player** (Bargain, and the Final Fantasy kickers): the cast option gives the possible permanents (`kickerPermanents`, the default choice first), and the decision designates the permanent by `sacrifice`. The interface asks which one if there is more than one possibility; with no choice, the cheapest (token first).
- **Behold** (701.63): the condition `cond.behold(filter)` replaces `beholdJace` (which becomes a special case): a matching permanent you control, or a matching card in your hand.
- **Earthbend** (Avatar): `fx.earthbend(ref, n)`. The land becomes a 0/0 creature with haste (still a land), gets N +1/+1 counters and the ability "when it dies or is exiled, return it to the battlefield tapped".
- **Player effect until end of turn:** `fx.thisTurn({ … })`, the `playerEffect` effect. For example `damageUnpreventable`: "damage can't be prevented this turn".
- **"One or two targets":** `target.between(1, 2, spec)` (`TargetSpec.minCount`, `TargetOption.min`).
- **"Becomes the target" trigger extended to spells:** `when.targetedByOpponent(filter, true)` ("a creature or creature spell you control", Surrak).
- **`adventure` filter** (cards outside the battlefield): "card with an Adventure" (Hearth Elemental).
- **Tools:**
  - `tools/meta-decks.ts` reads the meta decks;
  - `fuzz --pool meta` plays the playable meta decks;
  - `verify --set META` checks a meta lot; `--ci` and `--full` each have a meta fuzz;
  - the interface sandbox (dev mode) accepts cards in the graveyard (`graveyard`).

### Cards, by set

- **Secrets of Strixhaven (SOS):**
  - Great Hall of the Biblioplex: mana restricted to instants and sorceries; becomes a 2/4 Wizard creature;
  - Impractical Joke;
  - Prismari Charm;
  - Traumatic Critique.
- **Lorwyn Eclipsed (ECL):**
  - Steam Vents (shock land, read from the text);
  - Spell Snare;
  - Sunderflock: cost reduced by the greatest mana value among your Elementals;
  - Sear;
  - Sapling Nursery: affinity for Forests, 3/4 Treefolk token with reach (`ecl/common.ts`).
- **Avatar: The Last Airbender (TLA):**
  - Ba Sing Se;
  - Earthbender Ascension.
- **Wilds of Eldraine (WOE):**
  - Sleight of Hand;
  - Hearth Elemental // Stoke Genius (adventure);

- **Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMT):**
  - Escape Tunnel;
  - Leatherhead, Swamp Stalker: hexproof counter.
- **Murders at Karlov Manor (MKM):** Thundering Falls, surveil land; the `surveilLand` model also serves the other lands of this cycle.
- **Marvel's Spider-Man (SPM):**
  - Hydro-Man, Fluid Felon: becomes a land until your next turn;
  - Sandman, Shifting Scoundrel: returns from the graveyard with a land card.

## Lot M2 — Dimir Midrange and Jund Sacrifice (cumulative 43.7% of the meta)

23 cards: 15 from the main decks, 8 from the sideboards. Tests in `engine/test/meta.test.ts` ("lot M2").

### Engine

- **Optional blight as an additional cost** ("you may blight N", Lorwyn Eclipsed): read from the text, it is a {0} kicker that puts N -1/-1 counters on a creature you control (`kickerCost.blight`, `kickerKind: "blight"`). The creature is chosen like the Bargain permanent (`CastChoices.sacrifice`, `kickerPermanents`). "If the additional cost was paid": `cond.kicked`.
- **Teamwork N** (Marvel Super Heroes): read from the text, it is a {0} kicker "tap creatures with total power N or greater" (`kickerCost.tapPower`). The cast option gives `kickerTap` (like crew), the decision designates the creatures by `tap`; without `tap`, the weakest sufficient ones.
- **Amass** (701.47): `fx.amass(player, subtype, N)`, with a black 0/0 Army created if needed, which also becomes of that subtype.
- **Triggers:**
  - `when.search("opponent")`: "whenever an opponent searches their library" (`search` event, emitted by the search effect);
  - `when.leaves(filter)`: "whenever a [creature you control with a +1/+1 counter] leaves the battlefield";
  - `when.sacrifice(filter, false, true)`: sacrificed by an opponent.
- **`activatedReduction` static** (`playerStatic`): activated abilities of your permanents matching the filter cost {N} less (Mutagen Man: artifact tokens).
- **`damageHealsFirst` restriction** (Wolverine): new damage first heals the previous damage.
- **"MV X or less"** for mass effects (`modifyAll`, `destroyAll`): comparison `cmp.manaValue("<=", amount.x)`, with the spell's X.
- **Mutagen token** (`tmt/common.ts`).

### Cards, by set

- **Avatar: The Last Airbender (TLA):** Callous Inspector, Deadly Precision, Obsessive Pursuit, Wan Shi Tong, Librarian; in the sideboard, Day of Black Sun and Raven Eagle.
- **Marvel Super Heroes (MSH), new set started:** Hidden Lair, The Wondrous Wasp, We Say Thee Nay!, Wolverine, Fierce Fighter.
- **Lorwyn Eclipsed (ECL):** Blood Crypt and Overgrown Tomb (shock lands), Requiting Hex (blight 1).
- **The Hobbit (HOB):** Azog, Moria's Ruin (amass Goblins); The Sackville-Bagginses.

## Lot M3 — Dimir Excruciator, Azorius Control and Selesnya Landfall (cumulative 53.2% of the meta)

15 cards: 12 from the main decks, 3 from the sideboards (Day of Black Sun and Strategic Betrayal were done in lot M2). Tests in `engine/test/meta.test.ts` ("lot M3").

### Engine

- **Evoke** (702.74): read from the text; alternative cost (`altCost`, "Evoke — …") and the ability "when it enters, if it was evoked, sacrifice it" (`cond.evoked`).
- **Mana spent by type:** payment returns it (`payMana`, argument `spent`); it is kept on the spell and the permanent (`spentColors`), and read by `cond.spent("U", 2)` ("if {U}{U} was spent to cast it"). Enters conditions see it: it goes through the enters context, like evoke.
- **Mobilize N** (702.181, Tarkir: Dragonstorm): read from the text; N tapped and attacking red 1/1 Warriors, sacrificed at the beginning of the next end step.
- **Power-up** (Marvel Super Heroes): `activated({ powerUp: true })`, only once; the cost is reduced by the source's mana cost if it entered this turn (`abilityMana`).
- **Collect evidence N** as an optional additional cost ("you may collect evidence N"): read from the text ({0} kicker, `kickerCost.collectEvidence`); the graveyard cards are chosen automatically (most expensive first).
- **`fx.exileNamesakes`** (Deadly Cover-Up): a card from an opponent's graveyard and its namesakes (graveyard, hand, library); that player draws as many cards as were exiled from their hand.
- **Chosen land card name** (Petrified Hamlet): `fx.chooseForSelf("landName")` (enters triggered ability), `nameChosen` filter; the non-mana abilities of sources with the chosen name are blocked, as with Sorcerous Spyglass (`chosenNameAbilities: "forbid"`, PLAN-H H9).
- **Copy of a creature card from a graveyard on entering** (Superior Spider-Man, Mind Swap): `entersAsCopyOfGraveyard` (name, P/T) with `entersAsCopyAddSubtypes`; the copied card is exiled.

23 cards: 22 from the main decks, 1 from a sideboard. Tests in `engine/test/meta.test.ts` ("lot M4").

### Engine

- **Basic land type chosen when playing a land** (Multiversal Passage): `asEnters: [fx.chooseForSelf("landType")]`; `legalActions` offers one `playLand` option per type (`landType`, also for paying or not the 2 life), and the static `addChosen: "landType"` gives it that type (hence its mana). The shock land "Then you may pay 2 life" is read from the text.

- **Converge:** `amount.colorsSpent`, the colors of mana spent to cast the spell.

34 cards: 31 from the main decks, 3 from the sideboards. Tests in `engine/test/meta.test.ts` ("lot M5").

### Engine

- **Storied / enduring story** (The Hobbit): read from the text (`CardDef.storied`); a state-based action gives the controller of such a permanent, if they control three or more artifacts, legendaries and/or Sagas, a permanent player effect `enduringStory` (`cond.enduringStory`).
- **Sneak** (Ninja Turtles): read from the text; alternative cost possible during the declare blockers step (`cond.sneakWindow`), which returns your weakest unblocked attacker to hand; `cond.sneaked` on resolution.

- **Mode reserved for the paid cost** ("if the additional cost was paid, choose both"): a mode with `condition: cond.kicked` requires the kicker in the decision (`ModeOption.requiresKicker`; the interface and the AI pay it).
- **Linked reflexive ability:** `fx.reflexive(targets, effects, { c: ref.target("c") })` re-reads an object from the original ability.
- **Player effects:** `fx.thisTurn(ability, players)` for other players (`cantCastSpells`); `castCreaturesFromGraveyard`.
