# The Hobbit (HOB, 188 cards)

Mechanics and details of the lots.

Set requested by the user on 2026-10-02, after Marvel's Spider-Man and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. 20 cards were already handled since the meta phase (lots M1 to M6, `docs/extensions/meta.md`): Storied (read from the text, lasting story), amass Goblins, Landfall, Equipment… The set follows the integration rules of CLAUDE.md (debt, R1, R7). Split: one sublot and one commit per color for lot A, per mechanic for lot B, per family of unique cards afterwards.

| Mechanic | Lot |
|---|---|
| Core: tokens | 0 |
| Cards doable with the engine, by color | A1 to A6 |
| Remaining flagship mechanics | B |
| Legendary and unique cards | C and following |

The scripts are in `packages/cards/src/hob/`: `cards` (meta cards), `white`, `blue`, `black`, `red`, `green`, `multi` and `artifacts` (colorless and lands). The helpers are in `hob/common.ts`.

## Sublot 0: core ✅ (20 / 188)

- **Tokens:** white 1/1 Human Soldier, green 1/1 Elf, green 2/2 Bear, white 4/4 Bird Soldier with flying, red 6/6 Dragon with flying, Stone Boulder (colorless 3/1 Wall with defender), Axe (Equipment "+1/+0", equip {2}); Dwarf and Wolf already existed; Treasure and Food come from the commons.
- **Engine:** nothing new.

- **Engine fix:** choosing a creature type also offers the types of the tokens that the game's cards create (An Unexpected Party names the Dwarves its tokens create, with no nontoken Dwarf).
- **Smoke test:** every set now has its own file; `smoke/others.test.ts` remains for a set added without its own (it no longer fails when it has nothing to test).
- **Tests:** 31 rules tests ("lot A, white").

- **Engine fix:** a restricted mana ability ("spend this mana only to…") tapped by hand put its mana into the free pool; it now goes into the restricted pool, as during an automatic payment (Woodland Weavemaster, Castle Doom…; test in `rulings.test.ts`). The displayed pool shows this reserved mana, underlined with dots (`PlayerView.restrictedMana`, verified in the browser). `RULES_VERSION` = 57, golden games regenerated.

  - `RULES_VERSION` = 58, golden games regenerated.
- **Tests:** 11 rules tests ("lot C1").

## End of set: fixes found by the full verification

- **Control of an Aura (613.1b):** the control given by an Aura (or a "for as long as" effect) returns as soon as it leaves the battlefield, without waiting for state-based actions (Banishing Betrayal returns the Aura then asks for a scry; found by the "chaos" fuzz; test in `rulings.test.ts`). `RULES_VERSION` = 59.
- **Safety ceilings:** an expert AI simulation accumulated copies of Exalted Sunborn (token doubler) until it asked for 2^2058 tokens, an endless loop. An event creates at most 100 tokens, none beyond 400 objects on the battlefield, and a replaced amount is capped at one million; a draw stops at the empty library (found by the "AI levels" fuzz; general approximation in `docs/approximations.md`). `RULES_VERSION` = 60.
