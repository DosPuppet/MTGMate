# Marvel's Spider-Man (SPM, 188 cards)

Mechanics and details of the lots.

Set requested by the user on 2026-10-02, after Marvel Super Heroes, together with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and The Hobbit. 10 cards were already handled since the meta phase (lots M1 to M6, `docs/extensions/meta.md`): Web-slinging (read from the text, alternative cost that returns a tapped creature to hand), Mayhem (read from the text: a card discarded this turn is cast from the graveyard for its mayhem cost), Superior Spider-Man (copy of a graveyard card on entering)… The set follows the integration rules of CLAUDE.md (debt, R1, R7). Split: one sublot and one commit per color for lot A, per mechanic for lot B, per family of unique cards afterwards.

| Mechanic | Lot |
|---|---|
| Core: tokens, "modified" | 0 |
| Cards doable with the engine, by color | A1 to A6 |
| Remaining flagship mechanics | B |
| Legendary and unique cards | C and following |

The scripts are in `packages/cards/src/spm/`: `cards` (meta cards), `white`, `blue`, `black`, `red`, `green`, `multi` and `artifacts` (colorless and lands). The helpers are in `spm/common.ts`.

- **Cards (8):** Spiders-Man, Heroic Horde, Scarlet Spider, Ben Reilly, Peter Parker // Amazing Spider-Man, Norman Osborn // Green Goblin, Sandman's Quicksand, Alien Symbiosis, Oscorp Industries, Urban Retreat.
- **Engine:**
  - Web-slinging: the returned tapped creature is chosen by the player (`bounce` in the decision; `altBounce` in the option, the cheapest first and by default). The interface opens a choice window when there are several;
  - remembered way of casting (`castVia`: `webSlinging` or `mayhem`, on the stack item then on the permanent) and returned creature (`costBounced`): `cond.castVia(…)`, `ref.costBounced` (also read on entering: "X counters, where X is the mana value of the returned creature");
  - `altCostAll` accepts a spell filter and Web-slinging (Amazing Spider-Man: "your colored legendary spells have Web-slinging {G}{W}{U}");
  - mayhem given by a "play from the graveyard" permission (`playFrom.mayhem`, filter `discardedThisTurn`: Goblin Formula); mayhem of a land, with no cost (Oscorp Industries);
  - casting from the graveyard by discarding an extra card (`castFromGraveyard.discard`, Alien Symbiosis);
  - activation cost "return [a permanent] you control to its owner's hand" (`bounceOther`, Urban Retreat).
- **Tests:** 15 rules tests ("lot B1"); one-off Playwright script: the choice window for the returned creature (Scarlet Spider), screenshots in `test-results/spm/`.

## Sublot C1: copies and legends ✅ (175 / 188)

- **Cards (5):** Chameleon, Master of Disguise, The Clone Saga, Jackal, Genius Geneticist, Spider-Verse, Behold the Sinister Six!.
- **Engine:**
  - copy on entering "except its name is [its own]" (`entersAsCopyKeepName`);
  - nonlegendary copy of a spell (`fx.copySpell(…, { nonlegendary })`, `nextSpell.copyNonlegendary`): copiable exception of the token (707.9b);
  - an emblem keeps the chosen card name (The Clone Saga: `nameChosen` in its trigger's filter);
  - comparison `cmp.manaValue("=", amount.sourcePower)` ("with mana value equal to [the source]'s power"); the filters of "whenever you cast a spell" go through `resolveFilter`;
  - `noLegendRule` accepts a filter (Spider-Verse: your Spiders);
  - "do this only once each turn": `oncePerTurn: "ifDone"` and `fx.doneOncePerTurn` (the trigger comes back as long as the optional effect hasn't been done; justified debt entry);
  - targets with different names (`differentNames`, presented as the "different" constraint of the options, which the AI and the interface respect).
- **Tests:** 7 rules tests ("lot C1").

## Sublot C2: costs, amounts and players ✅ (182 / 188)

- **Cards (7):** The Soul Stone, Iron Spider, Stark Upgrade, Cheering Crowd, Mister Negative, Rhino, Barreling Brute, Kraven's Last Hunt, Kraven the Hunter.
- **Engine:**
  - activation costs: "exile [a permanent] you control" (`exileOther`); "remove N counters from among [your artifacts]" (`removeCounterFrom.n`, distributed, those with the most first);
  - `addMana` to another player (`who`: Cheering Crowd, the player whose main phase it is);
  - `fx.exchangeLife(a, b, store)`: exchange of life totals (701.12b), each gains or loses the difference; the controller's loss is remembered (justified debt entry);
  - turn log: the mana value of the spells cast (`minManaValue` in the query);
  - `amount.maxPower(filter, "graveyard")`: the greatest power among the cards in your graveyard;
  - permanents that left during the current decision (`GameState.leftBatch`, emptied at each decision) and `cond.eventObjectGreatestPower`: "the creature with the greatest power among that player's creatures" sees those that died at the same time by their last known information (a single draw after a mass destruction).
- **Debt:** "exploit" now serves two cards (The Mind Stone, The Soul Stone): its entry is removed.
- **Tests:** 11 rules tests ("lot C2").

## Sublot C3: unique cards ✅ (188 / 188)

- **Cards (6):** Arachne, Psionic Weaver, With Great Power . . ., Spider-Punk, Superior Foes of Spider-Man, Black Cat, Cunning Thief, Gwenom, Remorseless.
- **Engine:**
  - filter `typeChosen` (the card type chosen as an entering mode) and tax for all players (`costReduction.everyone`);
  - filter `attached: "toHost"` ("each Aura and Equipment attached to it"); damage replacement `redirectToAttached` ("dealt to the enchanted creature instead");
  - riot (702.136, `riot`, printed keyword): the choice is made when the creature spell resolves ("Riot: a +1/+1 counter or haste?"), also when riot is given by a permanent (Spider-Punk); without a resolution, haste if the creature can still attack this turn;
  - static `uncounterable` (`filter`, `abilities`, `everyone`): replaces `protectSpells` and `protectCreatureSpells` (one less flag). Chimil, the Inner Sun and Hexing Squelcher now protect all your spells, as their text says (approximation lifted, test in `rulings.test.ts`);
  - `grantPlay.replacePrevious` ("until you exile another card with this creature"); `lookAtTop.who` (an opponent's library);
  - playing from the top of the library by paying life equal to the mana value (`playFrom.payLifeManaValue`, like Valgavoth);
  - `RULES_VERSION` = 54, golden games regenerated.
- **Approximations:** Arachne (the opposing hand is not shown), Black Cat (face-up exile).
- **Tests:** 8 rules tests ("lot C3") and one in `rulings.test.ts`.
