# Avatar: The Last Airbender (TLA, 280 cards)

Mechanics and details of the lots.

Set requested by the user on 2026-10-02, before Marvel Super Heroes. 28 cards were already handled since the meta phase (lots M1 to M6, `docs/extensions/meta.md`): earthbend (`fx.earthbend`), airbend (`fx.airbend`) and firebending (read from the text), Lessons, Allies… The set follows the integration rules of CLAUDE.md (debt, R1, R7). Breakdown: one sub-lot and one commit per color for lot A, per mechanic for lot B, per family of unique cards afterwards.

| Mechanic | Lot |
|---|---|
| Foundation: waterbend (ability costs), firebending until end of combat, tokens | 0 |
| Cards feasible with the engine, by color | A1 to A6 |
| Remaining flagship mechanics (waterbend as a spell cost, "whenever you waterbend/earthbend/…") | B |
| Legendaries and unique cards | C and following |

The scripts are in `packages/cards/src/tla/`: `cards` (meta cards), `white`, `blue`, `black`, `red`, `green`, `multi`, `artifacts` (colorless cards and lands) and `legends`. The helpers are in `tla/common.ts`.

## Sub-lot 0: foundation ✅ (28 / 280)

- **Waterbend:** `activated({ mana: "{3}", waterbend: true, … })` ("Waterbend {3}: …"); when paying, each untapped artifact or creature you control can be tapped to pay {1} (`WATERBEND` source of the mana solver, after lands, capped by `ManaPurpose.waterbend`), X included ("Waterbend {X}").
- **Firebending N:** `firebending(n)` (DSL; N can be an amount); the mana lasts until end of combat (`fx.addManaUntilEndOfCombat`, `manaKeepCombat` pool), no longer until end of turn (approximation removed). Also read from the text among other keywords ("Flying, firebending 2", "Trample, firebending 4, haste").
- **Tokens:** 2/2 red Soldier with firebending 1, 1/1 red Monk with prowess, 4/4 green Bear; Ally, Spirit and 4/4 Dragon (firebending 4) already existed; Clue and Food come from the commons.
- **Rules version:** 38.

- **Left for later:** Foggy Swamp Visions and Ruinous Waterbending (waterbend as a spell cost), Koh, the Face Stealer (abilities of the last chosen card), Lo and Li, Twin Tutors (keywords given to spells), The Rise of Sozin // Fire Lord Sozin (total mana value X of the targets).

- **Engine:** nothing new; the foundation's firebending also serves as an amount (Firebending Student: "firebending X, where X is its power") and granted conditionally (Fire Nation Cadets).
- **Left for later:** Fated Firepower (damage increased by the number of fire counters), Firebender Ascension (copy a triggered ability from an attack), The Last Agni Kai (excess damage from a fight; keep red mana), Redirect Lightning (additional cost "5 life or {2}"), Sozin's Comet (foretell).

## Sub-lot A5: green cards ✅ (182 / 280)

- **Engine fix (608.2h):** the power and toughness of the creature of an event that left the battlefield ("when it dies, X is its power") are its last known information, not those of the card it became. The defect also affected cards already handled (Rakdos Joins Up, cards from ECL, MKM, FIN and LCI). Test drawn from the rules in `rulings.test.ts`.
- **Badgermole Cub:** its triggered mana ability is a mana replacement (R1, family I), like Lavaleaper (justified audit entry).

- **Engine:** "X can't be 0" (`activated({ minX: 1 })`): the ability is offered only if X can reach its minimum, an activation with a smaller X is refused, and the AI and the interface (X slider) respect it. Without it, the random AI activated Katara, Water Tribe's Hope for X = 0 endlessly (unfinished fuzz games). Gogo, Master of Mimicry (FIN) benefits. Rules version: 40. Fire Lord Zuko ("a permanent enters from exile", excluding spells cast from exile, already counted by his first half) goes through an exile → battlefield zone change; Fire Nation Warship also dies when it is not a creature (700.4, `putIntoGraveyardSelf`).
- **Left for later:** Avatar Aang ("whenever you waterbend…"), Hama, the Bloodbender (waterbend as an alternative cost), Iroh, Grand Lotus (flashback given to graveyard cards), Ozai, the Phoenix King (unspent mana that becomes red), Planetarium of Wan Shi Tong (cast the top card of the library), White Lotus Tile (largest number of creatures sharing a type).
- **Tests:** 43 rules tests ("lot A, multicolor") and 19 ("lot A, colorless and lands").

## Sub-lot B1: waterbend as a spell cost ✅ (261 / 280)

- **Cards (9):** Benevolent River Spirit, Crashing Wave, Spirit Water Revival, Secret of Bloodbending, The Unagi of Kyoshi Island, Waterbending Lesson, Foggy Swamp Visions, Ruinous Waterbending, Hama, the Bloodbender.
- **The engine gains:**
  - waterbend as an additional spell cost, read from the text: mandatory ("waterbend {5}", `CardDef.waterbend`), with X ("waterbend {X}", `xCost: "waterbend"`) or optional ("you may waterbend {N}", a `kickerKind: "waterbend"` kicker, read by `cond.kicked`); the part payable by tapping artifacts and creatures is exactly that of waterbend (`waterbendAmount`, `ManaPurpose.waterbend`), depending on the kicker and X;
  - ward "Ward—Waterbend {4}" (`ward.waterbend`), "unless you waterbend {2}" (`fx.unlessPays(…, { waterbend: true })`) and "you may waterbend" (`fx.mayWaterbend`);
  - linked cards cast by waterbending {X}, X being their mana value (`playFrom: { zone: "linked", waterbend }`, Hama; PLAN-H H7b);
  - control of a player during their next combat phase only (`fx.controlNextTurn(who, true)`, `turnControl.combatOnly`), announced in the log;
  - `fx.countersDivided(total, objects, { counter, anyNumber })`: another kind of counter (stun), divided on resolution among any number of objects.
- **Debt:** control of another player (`controlNextTurn`) now serves two cards: its entry is removed.
- **Rules version:** 41.
- **Tests:** 9 rules tests ("lot B1").

## Sub-lot B2: "whenever you waterbend" ✅ (262 / 280)

- **Card:** Avatar Aang // Aang, Master of Elements.
- **The engine gains:**
  - the event "you bend [the element]" (`bent`, `RulesEvent` `bend`): water when a waterbend cost is paid (ability, spell, ward, "unless", "you may"), earth and air when the effect happens, fire when the firebending ability resolves; noted in the turn log;
  - the trigger `when.bend(kinds?)` and the log query `{ event: "bend", distinctKinds: true }` ("if you have done all four this turn");
  - cost reduction by symbols (`spellCost.reduceSymbols`): each symbol removes a symbol of its color, otherwise {1} of the generic part (601.2f).
- **Approximation removed:** Aang, Swift Savior (meta) now pays "waterbend {8}" by also tapping his artifacts and creatures.
- **Rules version:** 42.
- **Tests:** 3 rules tests ("lot B2").

## Sub-lot C1: characteristics and amounts ✅ (268 / 280)

- **Cards (6):** Toph, the Blind Bandit, Earthen Ally, Diligent Zookeeper, Avatar Destiny, White Lotus Tile, Bumi, King of Three Trials.
- **The engine gains:**
  - in P/T defined by an ability: counters on permanents (`countersAmong`, Toph), colors among the permanents of a full filter (`colorsAmong`, "among your Allies"), excluded types and subtypes (`notTypes`, `notSubtype`);
  - `staticAbility(…, { perAmount })`: P/T multiplied by an amount computed like a CDA P/T (Earthen Ally);
  - `LayerMods.perOwnCreatureTypes`: a bonus multiplied, for each affected object, by its number of creature types, with a cap (Diligent Zookeeper; a changeling is also Human);
  - the amount `maxSharingCreatureType(filter)` ("the greatest number of creatures that share a creature type", changelings included);
  - the modes of a conditional triggered ability ("up to X modes" written as combinations, each with its condition, like the "one or both" already in place);
  - `fx.scry(n, player)`: scry done by a targeted player.
- **Approximation removed:** Dragonfly Swarm counts "noncreature, nonland" cards exactly.
- **Avatar Destiny** benefits from the 608.2h fix of lot A5 (the power of the dead creature).
- **Rules version:** 43.
- **Tests:** 6 rules tests ("lot C1").

## Sub-lot C2: casting and mana ✅ (275 / 280)

- **Cards (7):** Redirect Lightning, Sozin's Comet, The Last Agni Kai, Lo and Li, Twin Tutors, Iroh, Grand Lotus, Ozai, the Phoenix King, Planetarium of Wan Shi Tong.
- **The engine gains:**
  - foretell (702.143): "Foretell {2}{R}" read from the text, special action during your turn (pay {2}, exile the card from hand), cast on a later turn for the foretell cost (`exiledVia` of kind `foretell`); justified debt entry (a single card);
  - "as an additional cost, pay N life or pay {M}" (`kickerCost.life` with `kickerOrPay`, read from the text);
  - `playFrom` with `flashback` and `cost`: flashback given to graveyard cards (Iroh, Grand Lotus: their mana cost, or {1} for Lessons);
  - the top card of the library cast by a permission (`castNow`, Planetarium of Wan Shi Tong);
  - `fx.fight(a, b, storeExcess)`: the excess damage of a fight;
  - the `keepUnspentMana` family (500.4): these types do not empty (The Last Agni Kai, by `fx.thisTurn`), or all mana becomes red (Ozai); the condition `cond.manaPoolAtLeast(n)`, the mana pool now advancing the state version (layer cache);
  - `spellKeywords`: keywords given to the player's spells (Lo and Li: "your Lesson spells have lifelink"), read at damage time.
- **Rules version:** 44.
- **Tests:** 8 rules tests ("lot C2").

## Sub-lot C3: last unique cards ✅ (280 / 280)

- **Cards (5):** Destined Confrontation, Fated Firepower, Firebender Ascension, Koh, the Face Stealer, The Rise of Sozin // Fire Lord Sozin.
- **The engine gains:**
  - `fx.keep(players, "totalPower", filter, { max: N })` (operation `keep` since PLAN-H H8a): each player chooses permanents with total power N or less (a larger choice is refused), then all sacrifice the others at the same time;
  - `eventReplacement({ modify: { add: amount.countersOn(ref.self, kind) } })` (`addSourceCounters` before PLAN-H H7a): as much extra damage as there are counters of that kind on the replacement's source (Fated Firepower);
  - the event "an attacking creature caused one of its abilities to trigger" (`when.attackAbilityTriggered`) and the reference `ref.abilitiesFromEventObject` (the ability to copy);
  - the name chosen among designated cards (`fx.chooseForSelf("cardName", { optionsFrom })`) and `gainLinkedActivated: { triggered, chosenName }`: the activated and triggered abilities of the last linked card chosen (Koh);
  - `maxTotalManaValueAmount`: the total mana value of the targets of a reflexive ability, evaluated when it is put on the stack (Fire Lord Sozin: the X paid).
- **Debt:** `chooseCardName` and `exileNamed` now serve two cards (Ancient Vendetta, The Rise of Sozin): their entries are removed.
- **Rules version:** 45.
- **Tests:** 6 rules tests ("lot C3").
