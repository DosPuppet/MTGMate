# Marvel Super Heroes (MSH, 271 cards)

Mechanics and details of the lots.

Set requested by the user on 2026-10-02, after Avatar: The Last Airbender. 20 cards were already handled since the meta phase (lots M1 to M6, `docs/extensions/meta.md`): power-up (`activated({ powerUp: true })`), teamwork (read from the text, a kicker "tap creatures with total power N"), harness (`fx.harness`, `cond.harnessed`), equip worthy, Doombot… The set follows the integration rules of CLAUDE.md (debt, R1, R7). Breakdown: one sub-lot and one commit per color for lot A, per mechanic for lot B, per family of unique cards afterwards.

| Mechanic | Lot |
|---|---|
| Foundation: tokens | 0 |
| Cards feasible with the engine, by color | A1 to A6 |
| Remaining flagship mechanics | B |
| Legendaries and unique cards | C and following |

The scripts are in `packages/cards/src/msh/`: `cards` (meta cards), `white`, `blue`, `black`, `red`, `green`, `multi`, `artifacts` (colorless cards and lands) and `legends`. The helpers are in `msh/common.ts`.

- **Engine fixes (tests drawn from the rules in `rulings.test.ts`):**
  - the last known information of a permanent is taken before its removal from combat (506.4): "when an attacking creature dies" finally triggers;
  - an Equipment that becomes a creature becomes unattached (301.5c, 704.5n): animated Iron Man Armor;
  - a card from the library cast by a permission ("cast it now") follows the permission's timing;
  - P/T defined by an ability read "legendary" in their filters.

## Sub-lot B1: improvise ✅ (242 / 271)

- **Cards (2):** Arc Reactor, Ironheart, Clever Champion.
- **The engine gains:** improvise (702.126), read from the text (`improvise` keyword): when paying the spell, each untapped artifact can pay {1} of the generic cost (mana solver source, like waterbend, with no cap); it can also be given to the player's spells (`playerStatic({ spellKeywords: { filter, keywords: ["improvise"] } })`, Ironheart: "your noncreature spells").
- **Rules version:** 48.
- **Tests:** 2 rules tests ("lot B1").

## Sub-lot B2: shield counters and tapping ✅ (245 / 271)

- **Cards (3):** Captain America, Super-Soldier, Agent Maria Hill, Captain America, Living Legend.
- **The engine gains:**
  - shield counters (122.1c), the counter rule applied by the engine: a permanent that would be dealt damage or be destroyed loses a shield counter instead (a replacement, not a prevention);
  - the tap event carries its cause (`cause: "teamwork"`: tapped to pay a teamwork) and says whether it is the first tapping of the turn (`tapsThisTurn`); the trigger `{ on: "taps", cause, firstThisTurn }`.
- **Rules version:** 49.
- **Tests:** 4 rules tests ("lot B2").

## Sub-lot B3: power-up ✅ (247 / 271)

- **Cards (2):** Hulk, Gamma Goliath, Wonder Man, Hollywood Hero.
- **The engine gains:**
  - `abilityCost: { ability: "powerUp" }`: ability cost modifiers target power-ups (Hulk: "those of your other creatures cost {3} less");
  - once-only abilities count their activations; `powerUpExtraUses` allows activating each power-up N more times (Wonder Man; justified debt entry).
- **Approximation kept:** Kang the Conqueror ("this turn, power-up abilities can't be activated": an extra turn does not carry the effect yet).
- **Rules version:** 50.
- **Tests:** 2 rules tests ("lot B3").

## Sub-lot C1: characteristics, filters and costs ✅ (255 / 271)

- **Cards (8):** Super-Adaptoid, Ares, God of War, Namor the Sub-Mariner, Kid Loki, The Astonishing Ant-Man, Hawkeye, Young Avenger, Shang-Chi, Master of Kung Fu, Powerful Broker.
- **The engine gains:**
  - the filter `countersPutByYouThisTurn` ("that you put counters on this turn") also read by static abilities and triggers, and limited to one kind (`countersPutByYouThisTurn: "+1/+1"`, Kid Loki);
  - `playerStatic({ activateAsThoughHaste: filter })`: activate the {T} abilities of those creatures despite summoning sickness, without being able to attack (Shang-Chi; justified debt entry);
  - `modify.add: amount.powerOf(ref.self)` (`addSourcePower` before PLAN-H H7a): damage increased by the power of the replacement's source (Hawkeye, with `combat: false`);
  - the cost `removeCountersX` ("remove any number of counters from this creature", X = the number removed);
  - the amount `manaSymbolsOf(ref, color)` (mana symbols of a color in a cost, hybrids included: Namor);
  - `fx.proliferate(n, target)`: proliferate on only the designated objects or players (Powerful Broker).
- Ares and Super-Adaptoid benefit from the lot A6 fixes (last known information of an attacking creature, "legendary" in P/T defined by an ability).
- **Rules version:** 51.
- **Tests:** 8 rules tests ("lot C1").

## Sub-lot C2: copies, control and targets ✅ (263 / 271)

- **Cards (8):** Absorbing Man, Taskmaster, Mercenary Mimic, Evil's Thrall, Loki, God of Mischief, Loki Laufeyson, Scientist Supreme of A.I.M., Storm, Windrider, Leader, Super-Genius.
- **The engine gains:**
  - `fx.becomeCopy(…, "untilYourNextTurn", { except })`: a copy until your next turn, with copy exceptions (707.9b: name, types, supertypes, P/T, keywords); a creature card in a graveyard can be copied (Taskmaster);
  - the duration `endOfYourNextTurn` ("until the end of your next turn") and `fx.gainControl(…, { untilEndOfYourNextTurn })`;
  - the condition `cond.amountGreater(a, b)` ("a Villain with greater mana value");
  - `becomesTarget` with `players` and `abilitiesOnly` ("a player or permanent becomes the target of an ability you control");
  - the `nextSpell` filter fixed on resolution (Loki Laufeyson: "mana value at most its power");
  - the `stackItems` target with `controller` and `source` ("an ability you control from an artifact source");
  - the reference `ref.targetsOfEventObject` ("those creatures": the targets of the cast spell);
  - the replaceable event `connive` (Leader: draw a card first).
- **Rules version:** 52.
- **Tests:** 8 rules tests ("lot C2").

## Sub-lot C3: costs, hand and library ✅ (271 / 271)

- **Cards (8):** Trickster's Stratagem, Baron Helmut Zemo, Black Widow, Super Spy, Klaw, Sonic Subjugator, The Ruinous Wrecking Crew, The Serpent Society, Titania, Rugged Rumbler, Worlds Within Worlds.
- **The engine gains:**
  - `fx.topOrBottom(…, fromTop)`: "second from the top or on the bottom";
  - "discard a card or pay {M}", as an additional cost (`additionalCost.discardOr.mana`, choice offered by the interface and the AI) and as a ward (`ward.orMana`, read from the text);
  - the ward "get N poison counters" (`ward.poison`, read from the text);
  - `fx.discard(…, { chooser: "controller", reveal })`: the player first reveals N cards of their choice, you choose among them;
  - `fx.pickFromZone(…, { who })`: each player chooses in their own zone, for themselves;
  - `exileUntil` in another player's library (`who`);
  - the cost `exileGraveyardSymbols` ("exile [color] cards from your graveyard with total N symbols"), the reference `ref.costExiled` and `castCopiesFree(…, { maxCount })` (Baron Helmut Zemo's boast).
- **Rules version:** 53.
- **Tests:** 8 rules tests ("lot C3").
